                <p>
                    I'm a Software Engineering student starting in 2018/2019 and will finish in 2021/2022.
                    During my course, ran into a problem that i was nervous about not be fully prepared to
                    accupy a job opportunity. So, to face that, always in my free time, I watched youtube tutorials,
                    learn from documentations and started personal projects(as you can check in this site) to apply my teorical knowlegde.
                    Given that, I develop many technical skills as Java with Spring framework, reactJS, HTML-CSS-JS, docker, and could also improve my
                    programming logic.</p>
                <p>
                    To define my positive points I would say that I'm very dedicated, lean things quickly and my team work is greate because i could train in college.
                </p>
                <p>To define my negative points, I would say that i get nervouse and insecure sometimes when I develop something new or
                    deploy a new project. But to solve that, I've been learning how to write strong and consistent tests and with that I could feel better
                    when writing and deploying new projects and softwares.
